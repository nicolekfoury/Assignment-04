#### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
This project would support my user’s needs to find basic information about health-related topics, especially what tests and vaccines they should consider getting based on their age-range. This will hopefully serve Americans to make them more proactive and conscious of their health. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic (physiological) need for good health in order to survive. Maintaining good health is a cornerstone to everyone’s livelihood, and having a platform that allows users to access general questions pertaining to the topic easily would help facilitate users’ relationship to healthcare. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Currently, users can visit their doctor(s), Google whatever health questions they have, call hotlines, and read books to obtain the information/get the healthcare that they need. While these methods do still work, a centralized website that has an overarching umbrella of health information related to various topics can save users time and money when they just have general questions. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
When it comes to receiving healthcare, a website has its limitations of course. The lack of physicality means that users won’t get hands-on instruction, or the physical treatment to remediate any of their concerns. The website however, is not meant for this purpose. Rather, it is a stepping stone so that users are clear on what in-person healthcare. Getting immunizations, seeing a doctor, getting screened, etc. is the final step in their healthcare journey. 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: People living in America without expertise of health-related issues, most likely people of adolescent to middle-age that are concerned with taking matters of health into their own hands. 
Preferences: Users want to be conscious of their health and what vaccines/tests they need to take according to their age range, and therefore need a website to access an overview of information related to the various sub-topics of health needs. 
Expertise: Users do not need prior expertise to utilize this website. As a matter of fact, MyHealthfinder is geared towards individuals with a lack of knowledge, so that they are better informed.

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would most likely inquire about health-related topics from the comfort of their own home, but they could access the website from anywhere if need be. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To gain insight on whatever health issue a user is facing, a user would go to the website, search and/or locate the subtopic in mind, and read information pertaining to it in order to take health matters into their own hands.
